14:00|2:00 P.M.|Still, there were some things too precious to chance losing, so while the lovers drowsed and time dawdled on toward 2:00 P.M., Perry looked through old letters, photographs, clippings, and selected from them those mementos he meant to take with him.|In Cold Blood|Truman Capote
14:00|2 P.M.|But, damn it, you do worry scheme, fret over your fingernails and the warnings of hotel managements: “SU DÍA TERMINA A LAS 2 P.M.”|In Cold Blood|Truman Capote
14:00|two P.M.|Perry said: “For Christsake, Dick. Hurry it up will you? Our day ends at two P.M.”|In Cold Blood|Truman Capote
14:00|2:00 P.M.|On Saturday, the secobnd day of 1960, both rooms were booked for 2:00 P.M.—the hour that four detectives from Kansas had selected for their first confrontation of Hickock and Smith.|In Cold Blood|Truman Capote
14:30|two-thirty in the afternoon|But when the northern shoreline turned toward the west he heard the faint sound of a chirping bird far in the distance. This was near two-thirty in the afternoon. Shuya stopped to listen—and hurriedly looked at his watch.|Battle Royale|Koushun Takami
14:50|two-fifty|He talked for an hour and twenty-five minutes—from two-fifty to four-fifteen|In Cold Blood|Truman Capote

15:00|three|“I’ll now report the forbidden zones beginning this afternoon. Now please take notes. Take notes, now.” ⭐Shuya took out his map and a pen.

15:00|three o’clock|“I don’t want to hold you up,” he said. “How about this coming Friday? That should give me plenty of time. About three o’clock?”|Stoner|John Williams
15:00|three o’clock|He headed, with a kid of grim determination, toward the library; he intended to find an empty carrel and give the manuscript a hasty hour’s reading before his three o’clock appointment with Miss Driscoll.|Stoner|John Williams
15:00|three o’clock|The secretary—a new girl that Lomax had recently hired—said to him accusingly, almost insolently, “Miss Driscoll was here to see you at three o’clock. She waited nearly an hour.”|Stoner|John Williams
15:00|three|“What time did you leave Fort Scott?” ”That afternoon. We did some work on my car, and had a bowl of chili at the West Side Café. It must have been around three.”|In Cold Blood|Truman Capote
15:00|three|After the first day the men spent in the valley, it rained nearly every afternoon, so that they soon got in the habit of leaving their work at about three and lying about the camp under a tarpaulin stretched from the high sides of the wagon and pegged into the ground.|Butcher’s Crossing|John Williams

16:15|four-fifteen|He talked for an hour and twenty-five minutes—from two-fifty to four-fifteen|In Cold Blood|Truman Capote
16:30|four-thirty|Although it seemed only a few minutes had elapsed since he started reading, he glanced at his watch. It was nearly four-thirty.|Stoner|John Williams
16:30|four-thirty|Ordinarily, we feed just twice a day. Breakfast at seven-thirty, and at four-thirty, we serve the main meal.|In Cold Blood|Truman Capote
16:57|four fifty-seven|On the face of his women’s watch, with its elegant italicized numbers, the hands indicated four fifty-seven.|Battle Royale|Koushun Takami

17:00|five o’clock|Then a thought came to him, and he turned over his wrist to look at his watch. He was pretty sure they were somewhere near D-8, which Sakamochi had said would become a forbidden zone at five o’clock.|Battle Royale|Koushun Takami
17:00|five|A full one hundred meters down the slope, Kazuo Kiriyama didn’t look back. Instead, he glanced down at his watch. ⭐The second hand had just made its seventh click past five.|Battle Royale|Koushun Takami

18:00|six|At two o’clock we start the meal. It lasts till six.|All Quiet on the Western Front|Erich Maria Remarque
18:00|six p.m.|Shuya nodded. “Yeah. At eleven this will become a forbidden zone.” Sakamochi had said as much in his six p.m. announcement. The others were G-1 at seven and I-3 at nine; part of the southwestern short and the southern slope of the southern mountain.|Battle Royale|Koushun Takami
18:00|six o’clock|She had finished off the last of her bottled water by the time Sakamochi gave his six o’clock announcement.|Battle Royale|Koushun Takami

18:00|six p.m.|Kayoko Kotohiki was certainly somewhere on the island. And since Sakamochi hadn’t read her name in any of the announcements, she should still be alive—as long as she hadn’t died after six p.m.|Battle Royale|Koushun Takami
18:00|six o’clock|When Sakamochi reported Takako Chigsua’s dead in his six o’clock announcement, Shuya had worried how Hiroki would take it.|Battle Royale|Koushun Takami
18:00|six p.m.|Shuya lifted his limp arm with his right hand and looked at his watch. Beneath the muddy glass, the hands read five seconds past six p.m.|Battle Royale|Koushun Takami
18:00|six o’clock|But when the sun descend, when the shadows of the square’s giant shade trees met and combined, the coldness as well as darkness numbed the crowd. Numbed and pruned it; by six o’clock, fewer than three hundred persons remained.|In Cold Blood|Truman Capote
18:00|six|So I kind of had my heart in my mouth when I saw the cars arrive, saw the reporters, all the newspaper fellows running and pushing; but by then it was dark, after six, and bitter cold—more than half the crowd had given up and gone home.|In Cold Blood|Truman Capote
18:10|ten past six|While outlining his schemes for future financial betterment, he signed the check and pushed it across his desk. The time was ten past six, and the agent was anxious to go; his wife would be waiting supper.|In Cold Blood|Truman Capote

20:57|8:57|The evening was still a bit chilly for May, and the man’s disheveled, threadbare windbreaker made him stand out—just one of many fleeting impressions flowing beyond the bus windows, swept away by the low rumble of its engine.

21:00|nine|Shuya nodded. “Yeah. At eleven this will become a forbidden zone.” Sakamochi had said as much in his six p.m. announcement. The others were G-1 at seven and I-3 at nine; part of the southwestern short and the southern slope of the southern mountain.|Battle Royale|Koushun Takami

22:00|ten o’clock|By ten o’clock most of the guests had taken plates piled with sliced cold ham and turkey, pickled apricots, and the varied garniture of tiny tomatos, celery stalks,volives, pickles, crisp radishes, and little raw cauliflower ears; a few were drunk and would not eat.|Stoner|John Williams
22:00|ten o’clock|At ten o’clock we throw the bones of the sucking pigs outside the door. Then there is cognac and rum—also from the blessed supply dump—and once again long, fat cigars with belly-bands.|All Quiet on the Western Front|Erich Maria Remarque
22:00|ten|In other circumstances Mr. Clutter would have refused. His laws were laws, and one of them was: Nancy—and Kenyon, too—must be home by ten on weeknights, by twelve on Saturdays.|In Cold Blood|Truman Capote
22:00|ten|He worked straight through Friday, from eight o’clock in the morning until ten that night.|Stoner|John Williams

23:00|eleven|By eleven most of the guests had gone; among those who remained were Gordon and Caroline Finch, a few members of the department whom Stoner had known for several years, and Hollis Lomax. Lomax was quite drunk, though not ostentatiously so; he walked carefully, as if he carried a burden over uneven terrain, and his thin pale face shone through a film of sweat. The liquor loosened his tongue; and though he spoke precisely, his voice lost its edge of irony, and he appeared without defenses.|Stoner|John Williams

23:00|eleven o’clock|As the black Chevrolet regained the highway and hurried on across a countryside imperceptibly ascending toward the colder, cracker-dry climate of the high wheat plains, Perry closed his eyes and dozed off into a food-dazed semi-slumber, from which he woke to hear a voice reading the eleven o’clock news.|In Cold Blood|Truman Capote
