This folder contains miscellaneous files.

**`make_images.py`**
This file can be used if you want to generate .bmp images of the quotes for debugging, formatting, or some other purpose. The files will be saved to an `/images` folder in the root of this project. 

**`my-quotes.csv`**
This file contains all of the quotes that I have found myself while reading. These quotes have also been added to `quotes.csv`.
